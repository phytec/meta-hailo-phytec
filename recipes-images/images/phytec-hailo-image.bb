SUMMARY =  "PHYTEC's AiKit Hailo Demo image"
LICENSE = "MIT"

# Which Hailo accelerator chip this image is built for: "hailo8" (Hailo-8/8L/8R) or "hailo10"
# (Hailo-10H/15/Mars). Only ONE full stack (firmware, kernel driver, hailortcli, libhailort,
# libgsthailo, Python bindings) ever goes into a given image - not both. That's a real
# constraint, not just a style choice: HailoRT's master branch (used for Hailo-10/15) dropped
# Hailo-8 support entirely (see the hailo-ai/hailort README), so Hailo-8 needs a separate,
# older HailoRT line (branch 'hailo8'/4.23.0) with its own driver, firmware and Python wheel.
# Because each build only ever installs one of the two stacks, hailortcli/libhailort.so/
# libgsthailo.so keep their normal, doc-matching names no matter which chip is selected - the
# Hailo-10 packages (PN suffixed "10": hailort10cli, libhailort10, libgsthailo10) still install
# those exact same plain filenames, the "10" only exists so bitbake can carry both recipes
# side by side; whichever one HAILO_CHIP does NOT select is simply never installed.
#
# Hailo-8 boards release first, so that's the default. To build an image for a Hailo-10 board
# instead, set HAILO_CHIP = "hailo10" (e.g. in local.conf, on the bitbake command line, or by
# editing the line below) and rebuild.
